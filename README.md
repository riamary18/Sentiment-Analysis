# Sentiment-Analysis
This project utilizes two powerful models, VADER and RoBERTa, for sentiment analysis on textual data. We use NLTK on VADER and the Hugging Face transformers with RoBERTa. The combination of these models aims to provide a robust and accurate analysis of sentiment in various contexts.
